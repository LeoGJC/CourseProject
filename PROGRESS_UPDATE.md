# Overview
We are creating a web app that allows users to rank their favorite movies. We will then do sentiment analysis on reviews of those movies to show the user how similar their ranking is to how the general public would rank those movies.

There are 4 components to this project
- Frontend
- Backend REST Endpoints
- Review Scraping
- Sentiment Analysis

## Frontend
The frontend is finished. It's also been integrated with a mock endpoint until we create the real endpoint.

## Backend REST Endpoints
The web frontend will do the sentiment analysis by sending the user data to the backend which will run our python scripts. Right now, the frontend is communicating with a backend endpoint that returns fake data. We just need to drop in the real script once it's done.

## Review Scraping

## Sentiment Analysis

## Future Steps
- We need to decide how we want to display the result to users
- There may be some small changes to the frontend for showing results
